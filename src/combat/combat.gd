## The Combat class manages combat logic from beginning to end.
##
## The battle is composed from several components which should all be wrapped up in a [CombatArena].
## The Combat class instantiates the arena as a child before instantiating the player battlers and
## assigning them as descendants of the arena's [BattlerRoster].[br][br]
##
## The combat logic follows the pattern set by early JRPGs, where each combat round includes two
## phases:
## [br]	1) Action selection: each Battler selects an action, AI battlers followed by the player.
## [br]	2) Action execution: the Battlers carry out their selected actions.[br][br]
## If the player and enemy sides are both still alive, combat procedes to the next round. Combat
## logic may be illustrated as follows:[br][br]
## [method setup] combat with a [CombatArena] (usually triggered by
## [signal FieldEvents.combat_triggered]).
## [br]	- Begin new combat round
## [br]		- AI Battlers select their actions.
## [br]		- Until all player Battlers have a [member Battler.cached_action]:
## [br]			- The next player Battler selects their action via the [UICombat].
## [br]			- If all player Battlers have a [member Battler.cached_action], move to action
## execution.
## [br][br]		- For each Battler with a cached action (sorted by speed):
## [br]			- [method Battler.act]
## [br]		- If player and enemy Battlers are still alive, go to the next round.[br]
## [method shutdown] combat, cleaning up combat objects
## [br]	- Emit the [signal CombatEvents.combat_finished] signal.
